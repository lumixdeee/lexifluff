# lexifluff

Small language repairs for long-running teams.

Lexifluff is a lightweight collection of terminology tweaks and habits
that reduce friction caused by stale or over-worked abstractions.
It is intended for in-group, long-duration use.

This is not a framework, a manifesto, or a redefinition project.

---

## What this is

- a set of small language substitutions
- a way to flag known abstraction problems quickly
- a shared reference for teams who work together over time
- a friction-reduction tool, not a correctness tool

Lexifluff helps when language keeps causing arguments,
confusion, or false certainty.

---

## What this is not

- not universal
- not prescriptive
- not a belief system
- not something to sell

If it stops being useful, stop using it.

---

## When it helps

Lexifluff is useful when someone thinks:

- “This word is causing trouble again”
- “We’re arguing about the abstraction, not the work”
- “This sounds precise but isn’t helping us act”
- “We’ve had this conversation before”

The goal is not to resolve the concept,
but to **route attention** to a known issue and move on.

## Example substitutions

These are examples, not rules.
