mogrimentative
==============

Status
------
Lexifluff term 

Definition
----------
Describes a conversational state that is actively forming, shifting, or
reconfiguring itself, often with tension or friction, but without
implying hostility, bad faith, or fixed opposition.

A mogrimentative interaction is:
- in motion
- not yet settled
- not inherently adversarial

Usage
-----
Use instead of:
- argumentative
- combative
- confrontational
when the situation involves ongoing sense-making rather than attack.

Examples
--------
"The caller was mogrimentative, but not hostile."

"The discussion became mogrimentative as details were clarified."

"This stage of the process can feel mogrimentative before stabilising."

Why This Helps
--------------
- Avoids freezing people into negative roles
- Keeps situations framed as process, not conflict
- Reduces escalation while remaining honest about friction
- Allows staff to acknowledge difficulty without assigning blame

Notes
-----
Mogrimentative does not deny disagreement.
It describes disagreement as *active formation*, not fixed opposition.
