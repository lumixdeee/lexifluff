emmogrint
=========

Status
------
Lexifluff term (process-safe alternative to label-heavy phrasing)

Definition
----------
A person viewed in the context of an ongoing emmogrition phase.

Emmogrint is a process-framed reference: it points to "what is happening"
around movement and settlement, rather than fixing identity as a label.

Usage
-----
Use sparingly, mainly in informal internal discussion, when the goal is:
- to lower temperature
- to keep focus on process and integration mechanics
- to avoid label-first framing

Avoid in:
- official documents
- public-facing comms
- legal or policy text
(Use standard terms there.)

Examples
--------
"Some calls are mogrimentative because we’re mid-emmogrition - the new emmogrints
and long-timers are still demogrifying shared expectations."

"Let’s demogrify the onboarding path for emmogrints - signage, appointment flow,
and translation support."

Why This Helps
--------------
- Shifts attention from person-as-label to change-as-process
- Reduces adversarial framing
- Encourages operational thinking (what supports settlement and clarity)

Notes
-----
Emmogrint is not a substitute for precise legal categories.
It is a conversational tool for process-oriented framing.

Informal / Colloquial
--------------------

emo-grind
---------
Pronunciation-based informal variant of "emmogrint".

Refers to the felt emotional friction that can arise during emmogrition,
without assigning blame or fixed identity.

Often used humorously or gently to acknowledge strain.

Examples
--------
"Yeah, there’s a bit of emo-grind on the phones this week."
"That meeting had some emo-grind, but it demogrified by the end."

Notes
-----
"emo-grind" is affective, not descriptive.
It should not appear in formal or written records.
Its value is in lowering tension through recognisable tone.
