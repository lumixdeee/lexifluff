**Argument X**  
For discussions that don’t resolve - without anyone being wrong,  
hostile, or “losing”.

Sometimes a discussion stops because of time pressure,  
fatigue, or rising mutual confusion. Calling that an  
*argument* drags in person-hating baggage that doesn’t fit  
what actually happened.

**Unfinishment** is better *sometimes*.  
We pause because constraints dominate: time ran out,  
load rose, clarity dropped. Nothing broke. The discussion  
is left open, intact, and resumable.

**Mogriment** is better *other times*.  
We pause because meaning is still forming. Categories  
are slipping. Forcing resolution now would collapse  
future value. Ambiguity is being actively held,  
not avoided.

Argument X names a third space:  
not resolved, not failed, not abandoned -  
just parked safely.

A graceful exit protocol for discourse under pressure.
