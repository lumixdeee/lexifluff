TIME-VERBING (lexifluff)

Idea:
Instead of doing it *when*,
you are *when*-ing it.

You’re not describing execution.
You’re describing present state - where the item currently lives in time.

Examples (calendar containers - placement):
- morrow it / I'm morrowing it
- tonight it / I'm tonight-ing it
- Monday it / let's Monday it
- nextweek it / we're nextweek-ing this

Examples (rolling containers - span from now):
- next-hour it / I'm next-hour-ing it
- five-minutes it / five-minutes it then ping me
- shortly it / I'm shortly-ing that reply

Meaning:
Time-verbing turns a time word from a modifier into an operator.
"Do it tomorrow" is a plan about future action.
"Morrow it" is a statement about current placement.

Why it helps:
- Compresses coordination talk without adding pressure.
- Avoids false promises: you’re placing it, not swearing completion.
- Cuts managerial fog: fewer words, more signal.
- Makes "later" less slippery by naming the bucket.

A tiny history (why it was right, then wrong, now right again):
Early English was comfortable turning nouns into verbs, and "morrow" lived everywhere as a real everyday time-bucket.
Over time (especially early modern standardisation), taste shifted toward smoother, more Latinate phrasing - verbs were expected to sound like actions, while time got pushed into adverbs ("do it tomorrow").
Now we’re back under coordination pressure: bandwidth is scarce, and utility reads as good style.
So we re-open the old grammatical move: verb the time-bucket, state the placement.

Rule of thumb:
- If the time word names a shared container (tomorrow, Monday, next week), verbing cleanly places the item there.
- If the time word names a rolling span (next hour, five minutes), verbing usually implies "from now, over that span".

Non-goal:
This is not a new ontology. No new primitive claim.
This is just a lighter, more honest way to say what we're already doing with time.
