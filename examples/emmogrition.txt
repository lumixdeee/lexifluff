emmogrition
===========

Status
------
Lexifluff term (process descriptor)

Definition
----------
Describes a phase of population, cultural, or organisational change that
is ongoing, active, and still settling.

Emmogrition focuses on *process*, not judgement.
It does not imply benefit or harm, success or failure.

Usage
-----
Use when change is:
- real
- present
- not yet stabilised
- commonly mischaracterised as conflict

Examples
--------
"This service area is currently in an emmogrition phase."

"Some calls feel tense because the system is still emmogritionary."

"We should expect mogrimentative interactions during emmogrition."

Why This Helps
--------------
- Avoids moral or political framing
- Replaces adversarial language with process language
- Allows honest acknowledgement of strain without escalation
- Keeps discussions operational rather than ideological

Notes
-----
Emmogrition does not replace legal or policy terms.
It is a conversational and internal descriptor only.
