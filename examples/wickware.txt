WICKWARE (lexifluff definition)

Wickware is software that moves upstream by usefulness, not by authority.

It behaves like a fluid:
- it fits existing containers instead of demanding new ones
- it spreads through small helper persistence, not grand rollouts
- it survives because removing it makes things worse

Wickware is not a product pitch, ideology, or framework export.
It is an interface-level suppression / assist layer that:
- reduces friction for good-faith work
- increases friction for harmful or low-signal work
- stays inspectable, lightweight, and easy to diff

Success condition:
People adopt it without thinking, stop talking about it, and quietly rely on it.

Failure condition:
It needs explanation, credit, or belief to function.
