**Ignoreware**

Ignoreware is not just wasted effort or sunk cost.
It is active friction added to a system, and it
creates situational dishonesty.

Ignoreware appears when procedures, policies, or
frameworks exist but can be safely ignored without
consequence. It lives in documents, wikis, slides,
or onboarding sessions, but not in actual workflow.

The hidden costs of ignoreware:

- Extra cognitive load: people must remember what
  they are *supposed* to do while knowing they will
  not do it.

- Friction without effect: time is spent navigating
  around procedures that do not meaningfully shape
  behavior.

- Situational dishonesty: participants act as if the
  procedure matters while privately knowing it does
  not.

- Erosion of trust: repeated exposure teaches people
  that formal language is ornamental rather than real.

- Incentive distortion: honesty about uncertainty or
  pause becomes risky, so false certainty is rewarded.

Ignoreware is worse than absence.
A rule that everyone pretends to follow, is eating  
valuable time.

**Why lexifluff avoids ignoreware**

Lexifluff does not live in documents.
It lives in language used during the work itself.

When someone uses a term like *Unfinishment* or
*Mogriment*, the procedure is already executed.
The conversational state has changed.

This cannot be ignored without being visibly ignored.

Workflow continuation forces engagement because:
- the pause is named in-band
- the reason is encoded in the word
- the next move must respond to that state

There is no separate compliance step.
There is no external enforcement.
There is no performative agreement.

You can ignore a policy.
You cannot ignore a move that has already been played
in the conversation you are part of.

Lexifluff replaces ignoreware with unavoidable
interaction, removing the hidden costs of friction
and dishonesty while preserving forward motion.
