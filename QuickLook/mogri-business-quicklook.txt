Use mogrilateral when:
- the real agreement is behavioural, not textual
- trust, silence, or non-actions carry meaning
- enforcement happens by rupture, not review

Use mogriliteral when:
- someone insists the words are exact
- outcomes contradict the claimed precision
- “that’s not what it says” is used as a shield

Use mogriliteracy when:
- competence collapses under reframing
- skills fail outside their native environment
- fluency exists without adaptability

Use mogrileteracy when:
- an error opens a useful line of inquiry
- a slip suggests a new model worth testing
- exploration remains bounded and falsifiable

Do not moralise.
Observe which mode is active.
Respond accordingly.
